This Git project is a React/Node application featuring a CRUD CMS integrated with a MongoDB database. The website is styled using Tailwind and incorporates TypeScript for type checking. In addition, Framer Motion is utilized for managing animations.
Visitors can access the front pages of the website, while admins can manage works, services, and other page settings via the protected CMS, which requires login credentials.
